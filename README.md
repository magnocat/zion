## Technical Edge

ZION bridges the gap between Web UI limitations and raw API intelligence. It frequently detects threat indicators that manual platform searches fail to surface.

### Detection Strategies

- **TLD Inheritance**  
  Captures OTX pulses associated with root domains and related DNS or MX records.

- **ASN Correlation**  
  Identifies infrastructure hosted in ASN ranges historically linked to botnets, phishing, or abuse campaigns.

- **Low-Latency Intelligence**  
  Direct API consumption exposes threat data before it becomes indexed in graphical dashboards.

### 4. Understanding IP Discrepancies: Geo-DNS, CDNs & Threat Intelligence
When investigating a domain, you might notice that a local nslookup returns a different IP address than services like AbuseIPDB. This isn't an error; it's a reflection of how the modern internet works.

- **The Role of Geo-DNS and CDNs**:
Major service providers (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Cloudflare) operate through thousands of servers worldwide known as Edge Nodes.

- **Local Resolution**: When you run nslookup on your machine, the DNS resolves to the IP of the server closest to you to ensure the lowest possible latency.
- **Threat Intel Services (e.g., AbuseIPDB)**: These platforms often perform resolutions from servers located in different regions (typically the US or Europe) or display the infrastructure's primary origin IP rather than your local edge node.

- **Practical Example (Real-World Scenario)**:
Imagine you are investigating a suspicious domain, such as cdn-malicious.com.

- **On your local terminal (e.g., Brazil)**:
`nslookup cdn-malicious.com`
`Output: 189.x.x.x (A CDN node IP located in São Paulo)`

- **On AbuseIPDB (Global Query)**:
When searching the same domain, it might list:
`IP: 104.x.x.x (A Cloudflare main network IP in the US).`

The Difference: AbuseIPDB is showing you the "owner" of the IP block or the specific IP detected by their crawlers from a different geographical location.

- **Why is this critical for Threat Hunting**?
You must be aware of two key phenomena:

- **Fast Flux DNS**:
Attackers frequently change the IP address associated with a domain (every few minutes) to evade detection. What you see in nslookup now might differ from what was indexed 10 minutes ago.

- **Domain Fronting**:
Attackers may use a legitimate CDN domain to camouflage malicious traffic. Your local nslookup will show a legitimate CDN IP, while Threat Intel might be flagging the historical malicious behavior of that specific infrastructure in another region.

---

*The project is still in its early stages, but it brings a powerful concept to the table. When you search for an address, it doesn't just look up the target, it performs a triple-check, across the Domain, sub-domain (as www - the most common entry point), and IP. While a more aggressive reconnaissance feature to scan entire infrastructures is on the roadmap, the primary focus right now is to empower SOC teams. ZION provides a broader perspective that is essential for handling alerts, threat hunting, or executing incident responses.*

## Disclaimer & Purpose

**ZION** was developed to **streamline SOC operations**, drastically reducing manual reconnaissance time by consolidating fragmented intelligence into a single, actionable dashboard. 
The core mission is to replace repetitive, manual lookups with **instant, high-fidelity telemetry**, allowing analysts to focus on what matters: threat response.
